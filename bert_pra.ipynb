I have a IIsi that came\\nwith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\\n \\nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\\nover two months.\\n\\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare\\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\\nshorts or bad connections.\\n\\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what\\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not\\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\\n\\nHaving done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for\\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\\nday. \\n\\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of\\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any more questions.\",\n",

And when he was asked about it later by \\nreporters, he said -- quote -- \"That is a radical change in the tax \\nsystem of the United States.  It\\'s something I think we may have to \\nlook at in the years ahead.\"  Questioned again about it later he \\nsays, \"It is not something that is now under consideration.  If we \\nstart considering it, I\\'ll tell you.\"  It wasn\\'t a trial balloon or \\nanything, he said.  I was just discussing the tax response to a \\nquestion.  Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote -\\n- \"Certainly we\\'re looking at a VAT.\"  What\\'s gone on?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The same with Alice Rivlin this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The health care task force is \\nreviewing a number of options.  They haven\\'t made any decisions yet.  \\nAnd as I have said from this podium time and time again, we\\'re not \\ngoing to comment on decisions that haven\\'t been made.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But you have also said from this podium time and \\ntime again --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Wait a minute.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     that that was not under consideration.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes.  Clinton says, \"It is not something that is \\nnow under consideration.\"  Is that no longer true?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe the working group, as Ms. \\nShalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been \\nmade of any kind.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, I know.  But he said he\\'d tell us about it if \\nit was ever under consideration.  I take it that now he is and he \\ndidn\\'t tell us about it or --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Did he say if it was under \\nconsideration or if it was something to be proposed?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  \"If we start considering I\\'ll tell you.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If it\\'s something to be proposed?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  \"If we start considering it, I\\'ll tell you.\"  \\nThat\\'s a direct quote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The task force has looked at a \\nnumber of different options.  They have not made any decisions yet.  \\nThe President has not made any decisions yet.  This is -- one of the \\nproposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and \\ncast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform \\nthe health care system.  They have cast a very wide net.  They have \\nlooked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of \\ndifferent proposals.  But the President has not made any decisions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, is the President aware of their consideration \\nof this option?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if he\\'s been briefed \\non any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task \\nforce on this specific proposal of any kind.  I don\\'t know that \\nthat\\'s gotten to his level.  He started yesterday to go through with \\nthe task force a very wide range of decisions and I don\\'t believe \\nthat that\\'s been presented to him, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, he\\'s not relying on the USA Today to tell him \\nwhat his task force is considering in the way of taxes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he\\'s going through it in a very \\ndeliberate fashion.  There are a number of decisions that have to be \\nmade.  I don\\'t know that this proposal has reached that decision-\\nmaking point.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If this is still under consideration, that\\'s a \\nchange, at least from what we\\'ve been told by Dee Dee, I think about \\nthree weeks ago or so.  She said, that is not an option, talking \\nabout the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I \\nremember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice.  Is that \\nnot the case?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know if this has \\nbeen presented to the President as something that is being looked at \\nat some level in the task force.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It was ruled it out, though.  I mean, unlike other \\noptions that you\\'ve kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled \\nout.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, this is something that is \\nbeing looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind.  I mean, \\nit doesn\\'t -- it\\'s not necessarily material until you get to the \\ndecision-making phase.  The working groups are looking at hundreds of \\ndifferent options.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If it was ruled out before and it\\'s not ruled out \\nnow, then something has changed, George.  Yes, no?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When a guy says in February --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the working groups are \\nlooking at the widest possible range of options.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So something\\'s changed.  They weren\\'t looking at it \\nbefore; they\\'re looking at it now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don\\'t know if the working \\ngroups have gotten to that point yet.  They are casting a very wide \\nnet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able \\nto sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now \\nare saying that, in fact, it is being considered?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups are \\nlooking at a wide range of options.  They have not --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly \\nruled it out on several occasions in the past month?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t deny that -- I mean, those \\nare the President\\'s words.  Those are very clear.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Subsequent to the President\\'s words, do you deny \\nthat within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled \\nit out?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know about the timing.  I \\nthink what we did was refer back to the President\\'s words and say \\nthey stand.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So don\\'t they stand any longer?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five \\nyears it was ruled out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, those words -- the President \\ndid say that in February.  The working groups are on a separate \\ntrack, and as I said, I don\\'t believe --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Separate from the President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t believe this has been \\npresented to the President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are they considering something that the President \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has ruled out?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     has ruled out?  I mean, will the President \\nconsider a VAT tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups have not \\npresented this to the President.  They have looked at a wide range of \\noptions.  I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly \\nlisten to it.  That does not mean he has decided to do it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we put this another way?  In his answer in \\nOhio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax \\nsystem.  Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it \\nmight be considered at some future point.  Is that no longer the \\ncase, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I\\'m not sure exactly what \\nyou\\'re asking.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He talked about the VAT in the context of a \\nrestructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health \\ncare, for example.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Or anything else.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Or anything else.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It was always in the context of substituting for \\nother taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has that change, too?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that still his view?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I haven\\'t spoken about those \\nspecific comments.  I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the \\nworking groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT?  Yes, \\nthey have.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Certainly we\\'re looking at a VAT, she said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They have examined the possibility \\nof a VAT.  Has it been presented to the President?  Has he made a \\ndecision?  No, he has not.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What kind of a deal do you have when you\\'ve got the \\nPresident\\'s appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his \\nruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line \\nreform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has \\nspecifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then \\ngoes ahead and announces that that\\'s what they\\'re looking at?  Is the \\nPresident concerned about that sort of thing?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that the President\\'s \\nconcern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal \\npossible.  He\\'s concerned with making sure that they have the most \\nthorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the \\ndifferent alternatives.  If a decision is made to go forward with \\nsomething like that it\\'s certainly something the President will \\nexplain and justify.  But no decision has been made along those \\nlines.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What does it mean exactly, though, when the \\nPresident rules something out?  Does it mean it can get back on the \\ntable later if a more persuasive argument is made?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s just -- that\\'s indisputably \\ntrue.  If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in.  He \\nhas not made a proposal.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What makes him open to it now when he wasn\\'t open \\nto it before?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s certainly willing to listen to \\nthe argument.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was he willing to listen to the argument for a \\nshort-term tax this year, and he wasn\\'t willing to listen to it in \\nChilicothe?  He\\'s now open to it --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The context of his comments was \\nthat it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not \\nsomething he was proposing, not something he was floating.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Not something he was considering.  Those are his \\nwords -- \"It\\'s not something that\\'s now under consideration.  If we \\nstart considering it, I\\'ll tell you.\"  You\\'re now acknowledging, are \\nyou not, that it is under consideration and --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m acknowledging that the task \\nforce has studied this proposal.  I am also stating that the \\nPresident has not made a decision on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But the door is open for the President to \\nreconsider including this as part of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously, the working groups are \\nlooking at it.  Again, but the President has not made a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if they will make a presentation on \\nbehalf of the VAT to him?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know that.  I assume that \\nif -- I don\\'t know what stage they are it in proposing.  I don\\'t know \\nthat they\\'re going to make the conclusion that this is something they \\nshould present to him.  I know this is something the working groups \\nare looking at.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you understand, George, that none of us are \\nasking these questions in context of a decision that the President \\nhas made, only about what the President is considering?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I understand that, and I am \\nacknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a \\nVAT.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And the President will consider it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I assume that he will consider the \\nargument if it is presented to him.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does that mean the President -- that working groups \\nthink that when the President says no, he means maybe?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that means that the working \\ngroups are trying to do the most thorough job possible.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, can I ask you another question about \\nBosnia?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, he wants us to stay on this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Let\\'s do gays in the military.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, he got out of that swamp.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I think we\\'ve gotten the bottom line on that VAT.  \\nReggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said \\nthat if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked \\nout -- quote -- \"We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the \\narms embargo together with our allies.\"  That seems to go a bit \\nfurther than what you\\'ve just said --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sounds almost exactly what I just \\nsaid.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept \\nwhat Reggie --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President has said that \\nthis is something that\\'s under consideration.  It is something he \\nwill consider if the current actions don\\'t bring the Serbs to the \\ntable.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t there some kind of timetable here?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, there is a timetable.  There\\'s \\ngoing to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s on sanctions, that\\'s on tightening the \\nsanctions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s right, that\\'s sanctions.  \\nAnd we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope \\nthat that will bring the Serbs to the table.  As you know, Mr. \\nBartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also \\nworking on ways to bring the Serbs to the table.  We will continue to \\npressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option \\nas well.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The question is whether there\\'s a timetable for \\nconsideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo, \\nnot the sanctions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The next vote in the U.N. is on \\nsanctions.  As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting \\nthe arms embargo.  But it is something that we have discussed both \\ninternally and with our allies.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the \\nU.S. would do that?  What was the point of his telling them that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, clearly, I mean, this is \\nsomething that\\'s under consideration, and this is something that we \\ntake quite seriously if they do not come to the table.  They should \\nknow the consequences of failing to come to the table.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have they been given a deadline?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing \\nand it hasn\\'t seemed to change the Serbs\\' behavior in the least.  Why \\nshould the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo \\nwhen so far everything that\\'s been done has had no effect on the \\nfighting in Bosnia?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don\\'t accept the premise of \\nyour question.  It has had an effect; the embargo is having an \\neffect.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What effect?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If the Serbians choose not to heed \\nour warnings, then they will face the consequences.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What effect has it had in Bosnia?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the effect that it has had on \\nthe Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their \\nshipments through.  We can brief more fully --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In Bosnia, George.  In Bosnia what effect has it \\nhad?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it\\'s hard to say if it\\'s \\nstopped the aggression to date.  That is why we\\'re continuing to \\npress for the Serbians to stop.  But we believe that over time we \\nwill continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect.  \\nI\\'m not saying it\\'s going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn\\'t \\nhappened overnight.  But we believe that over time the sanctions can \\nweaken the Serbs.  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come \\nto the negotiating table, we\\'ll move forward with the embargo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t there a working deadline, George, of the 24th \\n-- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote?  Hasn\\'t the \\nUnited States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if \\nthe Serbs aren\\'t willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that \\nwe\\'ll seek -- haven\\'t we said that we will seek --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'ve said continually we\\'re going \\nto --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But on that deadline?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t have a specific date, but \\nwe\\'re going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution, \\nby around that time.  And if that fails to take effect, if that fails \\nto bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other \\nactions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t this awfully incremental?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re taking a step-by-step \\napproach.  We\\'re ratcheting up the pressure and we\\'re going to \\ncontinue to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there a possibility, George, that by the time \\nall these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved \\ntheir goals and then what\\'s the purpose?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the purpose is to get the \\nSerbs to stop the aggression.  We are pursuing that goal on many \\ndifferent fronts.  We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we\\'re \\npursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through \\ntightening the sanctions.  And we will consider lifting the arms \\nembargo.  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will \\ncontinue to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in \\ngetting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any \\ncampaign be to have the Serbs give back what they\\'ve gained?  I mean, \\nonce they\\'re entrenched --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t speculate on that.  We\\'re \\ngoing to continue to press for them to come to the table now.  We\\'re \\ngoing to continue to find ways to stop the aggression.  But I can\\'t \\nsee into the future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans \\nsay they\\'re going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to \\ntry and explain the details of your package.  They cite polls which \\nshow that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.  \\nWhat\\'s your strategy to counter that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The strategy we have is the one \\nwe\\'re going to continue.  As you saw, the President today pointed up \\nthe very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package \\nwill provide:  700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner \\ncities and suburbs to do productive work.  We are also going to point \\nout the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways.  \\nWe\\'re going to point up the benefits of immunization.  We\\'re going to \\npoint up the benefits of Head Start.  We are going to say that the \\nRepublicans have a choice:  they can take action to create jobs or \\nthey can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does it concern you, though, that the House now, \\nthe House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House Republicans voted against \\nit before.  They made a mistake then; they\\'re making a mistake now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, does it strike anybody in the \\nadministration that it\\'s a bit strong to describe, as the President \\ndid this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- \"a \\nreaffirmation of a promise of America\"?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I think it\\'s the \\npromise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full \\npotential. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Government-funded jobs?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To give people a chance to work?  \\nAbsolutely.  That is the promise of America.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday \\n-- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is on top of.  I did look at \\nit.  There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline.  This \\nwill be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus \\npackage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where does that number come from?  Because we\\'ve \\nbeen told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000 \\nnew jobs.  And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something \\nlike 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, but the summer -- that\\'s when \\nyou do their full-time equivalence.  I mean, 700,000 individuals will \\nreceive jobs this summer.  When you calculate it for the full-time \\njob effect, you have to do -- I don\\'t know what the exact formula is.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- 150,000 or --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  One to four because it\\'s three months.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can I follow up on that?  Did the President \\nmisspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money \\nfor these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the \\nprivate sector?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not necessarily.  I mean, I think \\nthat there will be grants available.  That\\'s one of the ways that you \\npay for the jobs.  At the same time, he\\'s also issued a challenge to \\nthe private sector to hire kids on their own as well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to \\nwork at Time-Warner?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the Time-Warner is actually \\nsomebody coming forward and actually doing a grant.  That\\'s going to \\nbe the bulk of it.  There could be isolated instances, though, where \\nthere would be grants to businesses.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has the President spoken with any Senate \\nRepublicans this week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  \\nNo, but there\\'s been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the \\nWhite House.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  At a lower level.  But the President hasn\\'t?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has not, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Getting any closer to get the votes?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re continuing to work on it. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Anybody leaning your way?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting \\nsomething of a breakthrough in Aristide\\'s attitude towards the coup \\nleaders.  Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what \\nimpact will it have on the process?  And what did Pezzullo have to \\nsay yesterday in his report?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pezzullo did brief the principals.  \\nI can\\'t confirm what\\'s actually happening in the talks.  I would \\nleave that to the negotiators themselves.  But Mr. Caputo has \\nreturned to Haiti.  We have received a briefing here at the White \\nHouse from Ambassador Pezzullo.  And as we have said time and time \\nagain, we believe that assurances of security are important to a \\nfinal resolution to a broader political settlement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, yesterday you offered some selective \\nbreakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities.  \\nCan we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be \\nimpacted?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we have it for most states, \\nyes.  And I think we can get it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you make that generally available?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe we can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And could you do it by the component of the \\nstimulus?  In other words --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if we can do -- I know \\nthat we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs.  I don\\'t know how \\ndeeply it can be broken down.  But clearly, we can break it down into \\nsummer jobs and other jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And can I follow up?  Is this the information that \\nJeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the \\nstates?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if they\\'re ads, but \\nthey\\'re press releases.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you describe what those press releases contain?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All we\\'re doing is pointing out the \\nbenefits of this package to various states.  For instance, I know \\nthat today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire.  \\nAnd I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package \\ncreates 1,000 jobs in Vermont.  It creates 2,000 jobs in New \\nHampshire.  And the people of those states should remind him that \\nthis is important. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where are the releases going?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They go to the states.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To whom?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We can get them.  It\\'s no problem.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we get it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why don\\'t you put them out here as well?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This afternoon?  Would that be possible?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'ll have to check.  I don\\'t know.  \\nBut as soon as we can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you focusing these press releases on states \\nwhere there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we\\'re trying to get as many \\nas we can.  It\\'s actually quite difficult to pull this together and \\nwe\\'re doing our best.  We\\'re putting them out as we get them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole\\'s \\nschedule?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I was just following it. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are press releases going along to states where he\\'s \\nvisiting?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure.  I think that \\nprobably there are press releases going to Vermont.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting?  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, as the President goes about the business of \\ndefending what\\'s in his stimulus package, he doesn\\'t address what \\nseems to be the Republicans\\' main point, that you\\'re funding it with \\ndeficit spending rather than \"if it\\'s so important, why not come up \\nwith the funding for it\" seems to be the Republican argument.  And \\nhow do you answer that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was answer is, we are paying \\nfor it over time.  And if you look at our budget, we pay for this \\npackage over time.  We believe right now the economy needs a jump-\\nstart for jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You\\'re not claiming, are you, that that doesn\\'t add \\nto the deficit this year?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m saying we\\'re paying for it over \\ntime.  I didn\\'t say that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know that, George.  But I mean, from the \\nbeginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things --\\ndeficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This year they clearly will.  But \\nover time our budget fully pays for this program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What you\\'re saying is that there are savings that \\nwould cover this if it were this year in future years?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  That\\'s exactly what I \\nsaid.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know that, but there is going to be outstanding \\ndebt, it will add to the national debt from this year --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, we\\'re reducing the deficit by \\n$500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You mean you\\'re reducing it below what it would \\nhave been?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Exactly.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In fact, you\\'re adding a very large amount to the \\nnational debt over the period of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But we\\'re reducing it far more from \\nwhat it would have been.  That\\'s true.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Washington-type reduction.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You\\'re getting to be a grumpy old man.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, has any decision been made about the White \\nHouse or the President\\'s participation in the gay rights march coming \\nup in a week and a half?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re working on the President\\'s \\nschedule now.  I believe he\\'s going to be at the Senate Democratic \\nretreat in Jamestown that weekend.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will he address it by phone?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know about that.  It\\'s a \\nlittle far out, but I believe he\\'s going to be in the Senate retreat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So will he have the leaders in a day or two before \\nthe speech?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.  I would expect that \\nat some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups.  \\nI don\\'t know the schedule on it, though.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in \\nconjunction with the event?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m just not sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  April 22nd is Earth Day.  What is the President \\ngoing to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign \\nthe biodiversity treaty that day?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know there\\'s been some work on \\nthe biodiversity treaty.  I don\\'t know about signing it that day, but \\nI would expect he\\'ll have a statement on Earth Day or right around \\nthen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'d have to check with Katie \\nMcGinty.  I just know that there\\'s been some work done, but I don\\'t \\nknow exactly what.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When is Earth Day?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The 22nd, I think.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why is it you know that he is going to have a \\nstatement on Earth Day but you don\\'t know if he\\'s going to have a \\nstatement on the gay rights march?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I said I don\\'t know if he\\'s going \\nto meet or when he\\'s going to meet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you have a statement on the gay rights march?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t, actually, no.  I wouldn\\'t \\nbe surprised if he did, though.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s a working visit on Friday and \\nthe President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of \\nissues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and \\nthe trade issues between the two countries.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There was some expectations that a second aid \\npackage to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if \\nI understand, it hasn\\'t happened.  Why is that or what\\'s the status \\non that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The G-7 meeting is still going on \\nand, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked \\nabout the outlines of a possible package.  But we\\'re going to \\ncontinue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q?\\t    We will not then make any kind of announcement \\nduring the two-day meeting?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The meeting\\'s not over yet.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that when you\\'re going to make one?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not ruling out the possibility.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     the President\\'s going to announce it tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Bentsen said that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, Bentsen said it would be tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So did Christopher.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'d have to look at that, but I \\nbelieve it is more likely that the announcement will come out of \\nTokyo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, has there been further consideration here \\nabout going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know that there\\'s -- it\\'s \\nnot something we\\'ve ruled out.  We don\\'t have a date set for it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, you all have a position or do you support \\nImmigration\\'s plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United \\nStates?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s the first I\\'ve heard of it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, there was a report today about the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Fortunately.  (Laughter.) \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     about the pace of appointments and says that \\nPresident Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions \\nthat people have been nominated for.  Are you going to speed up the \\npace of nominations or where do you stand with it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We filled 814 of the President\\'s \\nappointments.  And it\\'s broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147 \\nnoncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time.  I\\'m not sure what that means --\\n(laughter) -- 70 PA full-time.  And this is about the same -- it\\'s \\nabout the same pace of President Bush.  Obviously, as you move along \\nfarther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a \\nmultiplier effect and frees up far more appointments.  So we expect \\nthe process to speed up.  But we\\'re at the pace of Bush.  Obviously \\nwe\\'d like to get these done as quickly as possible.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would point out that the FBI background checks and the \\nbackground check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time \\nthan our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup.  But we\\'re \\nworking on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that because of Nannygate?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that\\'s an awful big part of \\nit, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In the story this morning, you were at \\napproximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way \\nbehind in winning confirmations.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s where the background checks \\ncomes into play.  That\\'s the problem.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s the background checks problem?  Because I \\nmean, you have a Democratic Senate --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, that\\'s not the -- you make the \\nappointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all \\nthe forms and have the background checks done.  That\\'s exactly where \\nthe problem is.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the President doing this afternoon, and \\nwhat\\'s on the plan for tomorrow?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s got some meetings -- just \\noffice meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of \\nissues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues.  And then \\nhe\\'ll be -- tomorrow we\\'ll have an event, probably again focused on \\nthe stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House.  And \\nFriday is the Miyazawa meeting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow, \\nGeorge?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Either tomorrow or Friday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the \\nJapanese Prime Minister\\'s visit tomorrow?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know about tomorrow, but \\nwe\\'ll probably get something done, as we usually do, for these \\nvisits.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you \\nknow what that was about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was here.  He met with a group \\nof us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Who?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Reverend Jackson.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Reverend Jackson.  Mack McLarty, \\nme, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Talking about Haiti?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We talked about general urban \\npolicy.  He is about to go to Los Angeles.  He was just back from \\nMississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he\\'s going \\non to Los Angeles.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did he request the meeting?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Actually, no.  He\\'s in continual \\ncontact with the President.  He had written a letter on a variety of \\nissues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords \\ntonight in Vermont.  Have you guys been  in contact with Jeffords at \\nall on this?\\n\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there\\'s been some contact, \\nsure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us about the contacts?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure -- \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know who contacted him or what was said?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that Howard Paster talked to \\nhim and they just has a general talk about the package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And did he express his support for it now, or is he \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t divulge the details of the \\nconversation, but there have been conversations.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion --\\nelective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care \\npackage.  Is this something the President is considering?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Along with the VAT?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s certainly something that\\'s \\nbeen looked at, but no decisions have been made.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What was the question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The L.A. Times story on whether \\nabortions will be covered by the President\\'s health plan.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your \\nmeeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice \\nabout what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of \\nthe verdict in L.A.?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we certainly talked about the \\nsituation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic \\ndevelopment and other issues.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  For instance, did you discuss whether it would be \\nhelpful for the President to go there or not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we discussed a wide range of \\nissues related to Los Angeles.  That was certainly one of them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in, \\nI need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, good.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     your reaction to Margaret Thatcher\\'s comments \\nthat you\\'re just sitting by and watching a massacre.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we\\'ve been pushing very hard \\non a number of fronts for more aggressive action.  We will continue \\nto do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us if you\\'ve made any progress in your \\ntalks on the stimulus package getting a compromise?  I mean, we don\\'t \\nhave any feel except talks are ongoing.  Have you talked to like 20 \\npeople or --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know the numbers.  We\\'ve \\ntalked to several people and we\\'ve had wide-ranging sessions.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Anyone leaning your way?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t get into that.  We\\'re just \\ngoing to keep working through Tuesday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\\n\\n                                 END                    1:10 P.M. EDT',\n",
